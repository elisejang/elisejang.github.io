            My name is Elise Jang, and I am a student at University of
            California, Irvine studying Computer Science with a specialization
            in Intelligent Systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love spending my time learning new topics, reading, going on
            picnics, and watching horror movies!

          <p>
            At UCI, I spent time getting involved in spaces where I was able to
            explore my interests socially and professionally. I joined
            <span style="color: black"
              >Women in Computer Science, Hack at UCI, Product at UCI, and
              Korean American Student Association
            </span>
            where I met life long mentors, alumni, and friends that I would be
            able to look up to and work alongside to create a community at UCI
            that I would want others to experience.
            <br />
            <br />

            This upcoming year, I am
            <span style="color: black"
              >Co-President of UCI's Korean American Student Association and
              Vice President of Finance at Product at UCI</span
            >, and I have spent time in Corporate and Outreach committees in
            Hack at UCI and Women in Computer Science.
            <br />
            <br />
            
            Since the start of college, I have been working at
            <span style="color: black"
              >WhizKidz as a Computer Science Instructor.</span
            >
            I've always had an interest in teaching and take the approach of
            asking, listening, being flexible in their needs as a student, and
            being an understanding and empathetic instructor.
            <br />
            <br />
            Starting off as an intern in the Summer of 2022, I worked
            at
            <span style="color: black"
              >Ingram Micro for 1 year and 3 months as a Project Manager
              Analyst.</span
            >
            During this time, I enjoyed and spearheaded the internship's Digital
            Transformation Documentation Project where I led a team of 10
            interns to interview, document, and present to Ingram's Executive
            Team our findings within a 3 week span!
            <br />
            <br />
            Since June 2023, I've worked with Noveil Inc., a dating app start-up, where I work as 
            a <span style="color: black"
            >Software Engineering Intern</span>
            and lead frontend development using Swift. I ideate, test, and develop features that would create
            the best user experience within our application that starts with video call icebreakers before matches.

            A project where we created a PPO Algorithm designed as a Gym environment for reinforcement learning. 
            The action space of (buy, hold, sell) for a reinforcement learning agent to interact with, the
            implementation of language semantics, and learnings from the year of 2008 brought promising results.

            A project where we worked alongside industry professionals on their travel start-up application called Odessey. 
            I worked with a team of 5 to create a database of cities and their core attributes around the world using different API's and compiling them
            into a working AWS database. Additionally, we were able to bring to life a working React Native frontend feature that 
            used the database and perfectly integrated into their application.
